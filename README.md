# RStatcastUtils
Utility Functions to work with Statcast Data in R

### Get Transverse Spin
The package currently only contains one function: get_transverse_spin(). This function takes statcast data as taken from  [Baseball Savant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/) and uses it to calculate transverse spin. The underlying calculations are based on [this paper](http://baseball.physics.illinois.edu/trackman/SpinAxis.pdf) by Dr. Alan Nathan.
